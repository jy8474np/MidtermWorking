My idea of a Sherlock Holmes wiki page became an interactive fan page with collapsible, a map with varied icons, a completable form, 
and a rotating carousel. I also formatted the font, colors, and style.

In addition to using previous projects and class slides as a resource, I utilized the following online resources while tailoring them enough 
to make the content specific to me and my project.
