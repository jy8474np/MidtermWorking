Intro

My initial idea of a Sherlock Holmes wiki page evolved into an interactive Sherlock Holmes fan page. I wanted to
feature several of the items we covered in our weekly labs, while adding some features we did not cover. The page
is also formatted for font, color, and other style elements.

The page features the following interactive content:
1. Collapsible content sections
2. A map with location-specific icons
3. A completable form
5. A rotating carousel

I used code examples, lab assignments, and PowerPoint slides from class as a resource; but I also utilized outside,
online resources as guides/tutorials for code with which I had difficulty or was inexperienced. I altered/tailored
these outside resources so that they are unique to my project and not simply copied and pasted in to my files. Links
to the various resources are listed below.



Main Pages
**********

My project folder contains many files, several of which are test and/or scratch paper files I used for experimentation,
writing and troubleshooting before adding code to its final location. These are available for your review, if you are
interested.

The three main pages that make up the final project are:

sherlockWorking.html
sherlockWorking.js
sherlockWorking.css

Page responsiveness is sometimes a little clunky, but I have found refreshing the page once or twice gets it to display
and function as intended without errors.
